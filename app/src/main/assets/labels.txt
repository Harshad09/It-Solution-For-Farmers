Pepper__bell___Bacterial_spot Solution : You can minimize problems with bacterial spot by following these tips: Select resistant varieties Purchase disease-free seed and transplants. Treat seeds by soaking them for 2 minutes in a 10% chlorine bleach solution (1 part bleach; 9 parts water). Thoroughly rinse seeds and dry them before planting. Mulch plants deeply with a thick organic material like newspaper covered with straw or grass clippings. Avoid overhead watering. Spray every 10-14 days with fixed copper (organic fungicide) to slow down the spread of infection. Rotate peppers to a different location if infections are severe and cover the soil with black plastic mulch or black landscape fabric prior to planting. Crop rotation can help prevent bacterial leaf spot. Do not plant peppers or tomatoes in a location where either of these crops has been grown in the past four or five years. At the end of the season, remove all crop debris from the garden and destroy it.

Potato___Early_blight Solution : Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems. Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut. Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry. For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed. Containing copper and pyrethrins, Bonide® Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days.

Potato___Late_blight Solution : Apply a copper based fungicide (2 oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application. Used as a foliar spray, Organocide® Plant Doctor will work its way through the entire plant to prevent fungal problems from occurring and attack existing many problems. Mix 2 tsp/ gallon of water and spray at transplant or when direct seeded crops are at 2-4 true leaf, then at 1-2 week intervals as required to control disease. Safely treat fungal problems with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis and is approved for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects. Monterey® All Natural Disease Control is a ready-to-use blend of naturally occurring ingredients that control most plant foliar diseases.
Tomato__Target_Spot Solution : Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores. Rotate crops and don’t plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year – primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course – tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three-year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi. Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren’t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil. 
Tomato__Tomato_mosaic_virus Solution : The only treatment is prevention. No chemical products are available to cure or protect plants. The best factor in controlling and reducing infection is to practice sanitation. Remove any infected plants, including the roots. Remove Also, discard any plants near those affected. Wash hands with milk or soap and water as this can reduce the risk of contamination by over 90%. A gardener that has been in contact with tobacco products absolutely must do this. The coat of the mosaic virus reacts with proteins in milk, so milk can be used to inactivate the virus. 
Tomato__Tomato_YellowLeaf__Curl_Virus Solution : Currently, the most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide the most effective treatment against virus transmission. Developing countries experience the most significant losses due to TYLCV infections due to the warm climate as well as the expensive costs of insecticides used as the control strategy. Other methods to control the spread of TYLCV include planting resistant/tolerant lines, crop rotation, and breeding for resistance of TYLCV. As with many other plant viruses, one of the most promising methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV. 
Tomato_Bacterial_spot Solution : Unfortunately, there is no bacterial speck treatment once the disease sets in. For the home gardener, if you can deal with the ugly spots, you can simply leave the plants in the garden as fruit from affected plants are perfectly safe to eat. If you&rsquo;re growing tomatoes for sale, you&rsquo;ll need to discard the plants and plant new plants in another location as the damage to the fruit will hurt your ability to sell them. Control for bacterial speck starts before you even grow the seeds. This disease hides within tomato seeds and is often how it is spread. Either buy seeds from a reliable source or treat your tomato seeds with one of the following methods for how to stop bacterial speck at the seed level: Soak seeds in a 20 percent bleach solution for 30 minutes (this may reduce germination) Soak seeds in water that is 125 F. (52 C.)A

Tomato_Late_blight Solution : The best control measure for tomato blight is prevention (see below). Remove and destroy infected leaves (be sure to wash your hands afterwards). Once blight is present and progresses, it becomes more resistant to biofungicide and fungicide. Treat it as soon as possible and on a schedule. Organic fungicides.&nbsp;Treat organically with&nbsp;copper spray, which you can purchase online, at the hardware store, or home improvement center. Follow label directions. You can apply until the leaves are dripping, once a week and after each rain. Or you can treat it organically with a biofungicide like&nbsp;Serenade. Follow label instructions. Chemical fungicides. Some gardeners prefer chemical fungicides, the best of which for tomatoes is&nbsp;chlorothalonil&nbsp;(sold as Fungonil, Daconil, or under other brand names. Check labels.
Tomato_Leaf_Mold Solution : When you notice the infected areas, the first thing you can do is let the plants air out. If they are being grown in a green house, air exposure is a must, because the humidity that the fungus needs to survive is dried up. If the tomatoes are being grown outside, try to keep from wetting the leaves when you are watering the plants. When you water the plants, earlier watering is optimal because it allows the plant time to dry when the sun comes, keeping humidity around leaves to a minimum. Another option for treatment is fungacide sprays. 
Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot Solution : The best control measure for tomato blight is prevention (see below). Remove and destroy infected leaves (be sure to wash your hands afterwards). Once blight is present and progresses, it becomes more resistant to biofungicide and fungicide. Treat it as soon as possible and on a schedule. 
Tomato_Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite Solution : Prune leaves, stems and other infested parts of plants well past any webbing and discard in trash (and not in compost piles). Don&rsquo;t be hesitant to pull entire plants to prevent the mites spreading to its neighbors. Use the&nbsp;Bug Blaster&nbsp;to wash plants with a strong stream of water and reduce pest numbers. Commercially available&nbsp;beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewing and predatory mites are important natural enemies. For best results, make releases when pest levels are low to medium.
